Calculator example in PHP

## Description

My first PHP app, trying out with a simple calculator.

## System Requirements

1. Windows 10

## Tools to install

As I am working on windows 10, instead of LAMP stack, I used the WAMP stack. From the Apache documentation, I have found this for [Downloading Apache for Windows](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/platform/windows.html#down).

From the available options for deploying Apache httpd(webserver) in Windows, I have chosen to install **Bitnami WAMP Stack**, provides a complete, fully-integrated and ready to run WAMP development environment.

#### Note: For further documentation, refer [Bitnami WAMP Stack Dcumentation](https://bitnami.com/stack/wamp/README.txt)

After installation, try the default port is 80 (localhost)

To test the web server and PHP are installed correctly:

Go to your main directory where the Apache installed

    "installdir/apache2/htdocs"

In my case, the path is

    C:\Bitnami\wampstack-7.4.7-0\apache2\htdocs
